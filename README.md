# algorithms_and_flowcharts
Here I add my projects of algorithms and flowcharts that I made (most of them created for college work). All of them are wrote in Portugol. For the Algorithms, I used the VisualG tool (installed in Debian OS) and for the flowcharts I used Visual Paradigm.

For maitain this repository organized, I'll create new branches for each algorithm/flowchart that I create. You can see all information of the algorithm/flowchart clicking in the branch with the name of the algorithm/flowchart.
